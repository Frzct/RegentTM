Regent is a website made for uhh recovering the student's attention span. 
In exchange for punishing them whenever they go off website, it will grant them rewards and some additional interaction. 
That helps their monkey brain be happy.

Made for the people. By the people, I mean the students. The teachers are not gonna have a good time using this app.
By made for the students, I don't mean playing subway surfers for them. I mean, actually helping them develop into actual people.
With actually good attention spans. Gen Alpha needs more of that.

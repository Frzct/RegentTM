We have an extension and a website.

The first basic necessities included to run the actual website is node.js and npm. To instsall node.js, follow the following documentation:

https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs

NOTE: When you install node.js, you also install npm along with it.

To run the website, type in your terminal:

- npm install --global yarn (Only for if you have npm, else install it by following:

https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

- Try: yarn --version (to check the version of Yarn, see if you have it right)

We already used "yarn init" on this project, so all you have to do now is type in your terminal:

- yarn start

it should run the project.

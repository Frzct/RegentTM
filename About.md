# ABOUT US

We make games

But this isn't a game.

Yeah.

We don't actually make games anyways. We could, but we shouldn't.

We want our application to be accessible everywhere. Even when you want to use it on a phone.

Ok liiu you better get your ahh to working or else i bring the belt and i whoop you.

## ABOUT US SECONDO

We are a group of... two students. Not very trustable, I know.

However, we have passion!!!! Passion to make something that's somewhat better than Canvas. But not in every way, just that it should restrict freedom.

We believe kids have too much freedom to do everything thats why we should control them.

Cool! We should host our website on vercel.com soon its free and it's cool thank you Vercel I bless you
